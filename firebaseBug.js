The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided configuration object is incorrect or incomplete.  For example, if you're missing an API key, database URL, or other critical property, initialization will fail.  Another common issue is using incorrect database rules that prevent data access.  Asynchronous operations may not be properly handled, leading to race conditions or unexpected behavior.  Improper error handling within your code can also lead to crashes.
